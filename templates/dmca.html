		<u>Introduction</u><br><br>
		This policy is intended to implement the
		procedures set forth in 17 U.S.C. Section 512 and the Digital Millennium
		Copyright Act ("DMCA") for the reporting of alleged copyright
		infringement. It is our policy (the "Company") to respect the legitimate
		rights of copyright owners, their agents, and representatives. Users of
		any part of the Company computing system are required to respect the
		legal protections provided by applicable copyright law.<br>
		<br><br>
		<u>Designated Agent</u><br>
		<br>
		The Company's Designated Agent to
		receive notification of alleged infringement under the DMCA is:<br>
		<br>
		Email: <a href="mailto:outfitsdailyy@gmail.com?subject=copyright issue">
outfitsdailyy@gmail.com</a>
		(this email address is only for copyright infringement claims - you will
		not receive a reply if the matter is not a copyright issue)
		Upon receipt of proper notification of claimed infringement, Company
		will follow the procedures outlined herein and in the DMCA.
		<br>
		<br><br>
		<u>Complaint Notice
		Procedures for Copyright Owners</u><br><br>
		The following elements must be included
		in your copyright infringement claim:<br>
		1. An electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or a
		person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right
		that is allegedly infringed.<br>
		<br>
		2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
		infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are
		covered by a single notice, a representative list of such works at that
		site.<br>
		<br>
		3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to
		be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or
		access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient
		to permit the Company to locate the material.<br>
		<br>
		4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the Company to contact
		the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if
		available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may
		be contacted.<br>
		<br>
		5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that
		use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
		copyright owner, its agent, or the law.<br>
		<br>
		6. A statement that the information in the notice is accurate, and under
		penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on
		behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.<br>
		<br>
		Failure to include all of the above information may result in a delay of
		the processing or the DCMA notification.<br>
		<br><br>
		<u>Notice and Takedown
		Procedure</u><br><br>
		It is expected that all users of any
		part of the Company system will comply with applicable copyright laws.
		However, if the Company receives proper notification of claimed
		copyright infringement it will respond expeditiously by removing, or
		disabling access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to
		be the subject of infringing activity. Company will comply with the
		appropriate provisions of the DMCA in the event a counter notification
		is received.<br>
		<br><br>
		<u>Repeat Infringers</u><br><br>
		Under appropriate circumstances, Company
		may, in its discretion, terminate authorization of users of its system
		or network who are repeat infringers.<br>
		<br><br>
		<u>Accommodation of Standard
		Technical Measures</u><br><br>
		It is Company policy to accommodate and
		not interfere with standard technical measures it determines are
		reasonable under the circumstances, i.e., technical measures that are
		used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works.
